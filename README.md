## Inspiration:
The inspiration for this app was in memory of my family's business that dealt with making and mantaining homeowner insurance policies and claims for their customers. It also came from using insurance apps and wanting to have a deeper understanding of how data is passed and kept within these amazing applications. My application creates a close mockup to most essential features when it comes to creating a policy including viewing, updating, creating, and deleting policies in accordance with CRUD-based web design.
## Features:
- Create a user profile
- View and update your profile
- Create a policy
- View your policies
- Update your policies
- Delete your policies
- Sign Out
- Image Upload
